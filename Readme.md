## SUSHI CHEF - an automatic cat feeder
This project is an IoT-enabled automatic cat feeder built with an ESP32 microcontroller, designed primarily as a hands-on learning experience rather than an innovative solution. The main goal is to gain practical experience with embedded systems, including understanding power management (working with VIN, 3.3V, and 5V pins), wiring sensors and actuators, and integrating multiple components like servo motors, OLED displays, and RTC modules. Through building this feeder, the project focuses on developing real-world skills in circuit design, troubleshooting hardware issues, managing current draw from different components, and writing firmware that coordinates multiple subsystems. While the end result will be a functional cat feeder that dispenses food on schedule, the true value lies in the hands-on experience gained from assembling, powering, programming, and debugging a complete embedded system from scratch.
